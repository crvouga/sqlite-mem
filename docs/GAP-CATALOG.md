# Gap Catalog — drop-in proof inventory

**Status:** Phase 0 (2026-08-20). Authoritative inventory of what is *differentially proven* vs *claimed* vs *intentionally different* for `@crvouga/sqlite-mem` as a client-side drop-in for SQLite **3.51.0** (`bun:sqlite`; Linux/Windows may report **3.53.0**).

This file supersedes [`docs/PARITY-GAPS.md`](PARITY-GAPS.md) as the **current** unproven-inventory. PARITY-GAPS remains historical (many of its “LIKELY DIVERGENCE” P0 items were closed in the 2026-08-19 hardening pass — see [Closed since PARITY-GAPS](#closed-since-parity-gaps)).

**Proof vocabulary**

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Proven** | Differential (`parity` / `execParity` / `errorParity` / `sequenceParity` / fuzz) covers happy path **and** meaningful edges vs oracle |
| **Thin** | Some differential; important app forms still missing |
| **Unproven** | Implemented or claimed; no oracle proof (or only ISOLATED `new Database()`) |
| **Intentional** | Documented in [`compat/divergences.json`](../compat/divergences.json) / README; proof = limitation pin, not oracle equality |
| **N/A** | Outside Scope 3 (C API, on-disk `.sqlite`, VFS/pager/WAL) |

**Severity** (drop-in readiness, not “invented bugs”)

| Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **blocker** | Browser first-class claim without in-browser SQL proof, or marketed VERIFIED surface with no differential on a user path |
| **high** | Thin/unproven app-SQL or API edges (ORM, binds, counters, txn+snapshot simulation) |
| **medium** | Exotic / PARTIAL areas (FTS edges, window options, date modifiers) |
| **low** | Smoke ratchet leftovers, extensions, planner essays |

**Authoritative gate:** `bun run test:sqlite-compat`. Isolated unit tests are never SQLite proof.

**Candidate intentional pins to add (after tests):** `generate_series` extension; UUID seeded vs oracle entropy; `case_sensitive_like` not in SQLM; REGEXP without `regexp()` builtin (already error-parity).

## Next proof obligations (blocker → high)

Ordered after 2026-08-20 Wave 1–5 dialect pass (many former highs are **closed** — see [PROOF.md](PROOF.md)):

1. **medium — Implement pragma setters** for `defer_foreign_keys` / `recursive_triggers` / `application_id` (currently pinned no-ops).
2. **medium — Deepen FTS / window / date** remaining thin edges beyond recent promotions.
3. **major (WASM claim only) — `.sqlite` codec, UDFs, API adapters** — product work, not dialect tests.
4. **major — sqllogictest / multi-oracle / full in-browser contract** — external corpora and runtime matrix.
5. **docs — Keep GAP-ANALYSIS Phase 0 tables in sync** with PROOF.md (several P1/meta items already closed).

### Closed since prior “Next proof obligations” list

Browser SQL smoke in CI; `?NNN`; `NOT IN (SELECT)` NULL trap; multi-`exec` counters; bind rejection pins; error/subquery depth; UPSERT/UPDATE FROM/windows/JSON/date/collate/FK+trigger edges; mixed stateful simulation; smoke-baseline emptied; affinity/bind/malformed fuzz + determinism properties.

## How to re-verify this catalog

```bash
bun run test:sqlite-compat   # fail-closed gate + contract/fuzz/harness
bun run inventory            # oracle function/module names
bun run scenarios            # construct catalog
bun run build && bun run verify-package  # isomorphic ESM
# Browser dialect suite: not yet (Phase 2). Optional perf: bun run test:browser
```

When closing a row: change severity notes to **Proven**, cite `file:test` or catalog ID, and update [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](../COMPATIBILITY.md) / [`COMPATIBILITY-AUDIT.md`](../COMPATIBILITY-AUDIT.md) only with evidence.
